Description: server for controlling RepRap 3-D robot
 3-D robots such as 3-D printers need firmware and host software to work.  This
 package contains both.  The following hardware is currently supported:
  * Controller board: all Arduino-based should work.
    Melzi, Ramps and Rambo have been tested.
  * Robot type: Carthesian, Delta, Polar and H-Bot.
 If you need support for other controllers or robot types, let me know.
 .
 The server provides a web interface to a 3-D robot.  It also provides an
 interface for scripted control using websockets, with example scripts in
 Python.
